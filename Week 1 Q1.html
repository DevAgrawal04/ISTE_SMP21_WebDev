    <h1>Naruto</h1>
    <p>
          Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. 
          It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. 
          The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. 
          The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), 
          which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
